# Parcels simulation configuration

This is where the configs go.

**Note many of the options in the config are optional.**

example layout:

```yaml
# this section should contain all information about the surface
# current datasets you want to run simulations on
# you can have multiple ocean datasets to compare different models
ocean_data:
  - name: dataset name
    data: url or path to surface current data
    # spatial domain of data to extract: South, North, West, East
    domain:
      S: 38.162201
      N: 41.520008
      W: -75.709632
      E: -69.723751
    # time range of data to extract: [start time, end time]
    time_range: [2021-08-21T12:00, 2021-08-23T18:00]
    # define how to perform spatial gapfilling of the data
    gapfill_steps:
      # example here using penalized least squares filling
      - path: pyplume.gapfilling.DCTPLS
        args:
          mask: path to mask
    # null, partialslip, or freeslip
    boundary_condition: freeslip
    # allow simulations to go outside the data's available time range
    allow_time_extrapolation: True
    # specify wind data to modify the behavior of particle advection
    # currently only supports a single timeseries of wind to apply
    # uniformly across the surface currents
    wind:
      data: path to data
      # ratio of wind speed to add to surface currents
      ratio: 0.15
      # if direction of wind in data is incoming or outgoing
      incoming: False
  # include other datasets for comparison if needed
  - name: another dataset

  # The start and end time of the simulation. START and END are special keywords that
  # denote the start and end times of the used NetCDF respectively.
  ###### IMPORTANT NOTE ######
  # if particles are scheduled to released individually, START will use the
  # earliest time a particle is released instead of the start of the NetCDF. It is highly
  # recommended to use START to avoid out of bounds errors.
  ### END OF IMPORTANT NOTE ###
  # Integers will be treated as delta time in hours. For example, [6, "END"] will run the
  # simulation from 6 hours before the end until the end
  time_range: [2020-07-16T00:00, END]
  ########## repetition settings ##########
  # The number of times to release the particles. If repeat_dt is 0 or less, this parameter
  # is ignored.
  repetitions: 5  # default -1
  # The time between particle spawn release in seconds. If this is positive and repetitions
  # is 0 or less, the simulation will attempt to release at the said rate until the end of
  # the simulation
  repeat_dt: 14400  # default -1
  # Number of times per release to spawn particles from the defined spawn points.
  # There is only a visual difference if there is randomness to particle movement.
  instances_per_spawn: 50  # default 1
  # spawn points can be either loaded in straight as a 2d list of (lat, lon) pairs
